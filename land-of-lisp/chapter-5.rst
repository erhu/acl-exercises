What I learned at Chapter 5
============

1. ``alist`` (association list):

::

   (defparameter *nodes* '(a (a 1))
                          (b (b 2)))

2. Use ``assoc`` to look up a key in an ``alist``.

3. ``Quasiquoting`` is a technique that allows you to insert small bit of computer code into larger pieces of data.

4. Higher-order like ``mapcar``.
