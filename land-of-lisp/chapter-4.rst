Learning notes of cp4
======================

1. Use ``eq`` to compare symbals, use ``equal`` for everything else;
2. ``eql`` is similar to ``eq``, but it also handles comparisons of numbers and characters;
3. ``equalp`` is similar to ``equal``, except that it can handle some difficult comparision, for instance, strings with different CAPS and integers against floating poing numbers;


What we've learned:
====================
1. nil, 'nil, (), '();
2. ``if``, ``when``, ``unless``, ``cond``, ``case``, ``find-if``;
3. ``and``, ``or``;
4. ``memeber``;
5. ``eq``, ``equal``, ``eql``, ``equalp``;
6. ``#'``
