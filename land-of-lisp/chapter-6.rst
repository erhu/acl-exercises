What I've Learned
===========

1. ``read`` and ``print`` let you directly communicate with the user through the concel.
2. Sometimes you should use ``princ`` and ``read-line``.
3. Know ``homoiconic``, ``eval``.
4. By using lambda, you can create a function without needing go give it a name.
5. Know ``higher-order functional programming``.
